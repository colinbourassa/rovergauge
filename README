RoverGauge
----------
RoverGauge is a graphical display and diagnostic tool that reads runtime data
from a Lucas 14CUX engine management system. The 14CUX was paired with the
Rover V8 engine in Land Rover vehicles from 1990 to 1995, and also in sports
cars made by low-volume automakers (TVR, Morgan, etc.) throughout the 1990s.

RoverGauge depends on another piece of software that I wrote, libcomm14cux.
Each of these two projects has its own Google Project page:

Installing and running
----------------------
If you're running Windows, the simplest way to get started is to download the
Win32 binary archive. Most people will probably want to do this. The archive
contains the RoverGauge executable, Qt libraries, and libcomm14cux library,
all of which are required to run. The files should simply all be placed in the
same directory with rovergauge.exe.

If you're running Linux, you can get a Debian package (.DEB) for your system's
architecture.

It's also possible to build RoverGauge from the code yourself. This can be done
with Linux or Windows. In either case, you'll CMake (version 2.8.11 or newer)
and you'll need version 5.x of the Qt SDK.

------------------
Usage and features
------------------
For RoverGauge to do anything useful, the computer on which it's running must
be connected to the serial port in the 14CUX wiring harness. This requires
building a custom cable using one of FTDI's USB-to-RS232 converters. You can
find the details of this on either of these two pages:

http://code.google.com/p/libcomm14cux/wiki/HardwareInterface
http://alum.wpi.edu/~colinb/14cux_interface.html

When the USB FTDI device is connected to the PC, its driver will present it
as a COM port if using Windows, or a /dev node if using Linux. Enter the name
of the device (such as "COM3") in the "Serial device name" field of the
"Edit settings" dialog, under the "Options" menu. (The software will attempt to
populate the list of serial devices automatically, so that you can simply
select it from the drop-down box.)

Once the device name is set and the 14CUX is running, use the "Connect" button
in the upper left of the main window to open the serial port and begin reading
data. The "Communications" lights in the upper right will show the status:
green if everything is working and the 14CUX is responding to read requests, or
red if there's a problem. The red light will be lit if the 14CUX is off, if
the serial cable wasn't wired correctly, or if the wrong COM port was chosen.

To access the online help about the data displayed by RoverGauge, open the
"Help" menu and select "Contents..."

FAQ
---
Q: Is this an alternative to OBD-II code readers or OBD-II diagnostic software?

A: No. The 14CUX system doesn't conform to the OBD-II standard. This software
uses a library that I wrote specifically to communicate with the 14CUX, using
the ECU's unusual baud rate and proprietary software protocol. The details of
all of this were discovered through reverse-engineering the code in the 14CUX
ROM.


Q: Can this software be used to modify the code or data in the ECU (such as the
fuel maps)?

A: Unfortunately, no. When the ECU is running, it reads fueling values from the
ROM. Modifying the ROM requires removing and reprogramming the chip.

Notes on building from source under Windows
-------------------------------------------
If building from source in a Windows environment, note that the default
installation of Qt includes a dependency on the ICU internationalization
libraries. The Win32 build of RoverGauge that I provide was linked against
a customized build of Qt and does not have these dependencies. If you'd like to
build Qt in a similar way, configure the Qt source tree with this command:

configure.bat -release -opensource -no-icu -no-opengl -nomake examples -nomake tests

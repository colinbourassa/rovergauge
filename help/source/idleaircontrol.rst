Idle air control
================
This dialog allows the user to control the idle air control valve in the intake plenum. Because the ECU is adjusting the valve when the engine is idling, it is recommended to only test movement of the valve when the engine is off.

The motor controlling the valve has a total of 180 steps of movement, so commanding it to open or close by 180 (or more) steps will ensure that it reaches its fully-open or fully-closed position (assuming the valve is functioning mechanically.)

Options dialog
==============
Following is a description of the configuration options available in the "Options" -> "Edit settings" dialog.

 * **Serial device name:** The name of the serial device connected to the 14CUX. If running Windows, this will be something like "COM2". If running Linux, it will be something like "/dev/ttyUSB0".

 * **Maximum speed on speedometer:** This merely changes the upper limit of the speedometer gauge. Because of limitations in the gauge display itself, only coarse changes will affect this setting.

 * **Temperature units:** Sets the preferred units of temperature for the coolant- and fuel-temperature displays.

 * **Enabled readings:** These checkboxes allow the user to enable reading only certain parameters. This allows the limited bandwidth of the diagnostic port to be used for only those parameters that interest the user. If fewer readings are enabled, they will update more quickly and smoothly than if all the readings are enabled.

    <h3>Main display</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>MIL:</b> Lit red when the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) is being lit by the ECU. This indicates that at least one fault code is set.</li>
    <li><b>Communications:</b> The green lamp is lit when the software is successfully reading data from the ECU, and the red lamp is lit when there was a problem communicating with the ECU (caused by a bad connection, disconnected cable, misconfigured USB adapter, or other problem.) Both lamps will be off if there has not been any attempt to read from the ECU.</li>
    <li><b>Engine temperature:</b> Displays the temperature read by the engine/coolant temperature sensor. The green and red colored areas (representing "nominal" and "warning" temperature levels) are approximate.</li>
    <li><b>Road speed:</b> Displays road speed. Note that some vehicles (including TVR) use a different road speed transducer setup, and the measurement on those vehicles may not be updated above a certain speed.</li>
    <li><b>RPM (tachometer):</b> Displays engine speed in revolutions per minute. The redline represents the RPM limit stored in the ECU.</li>
    <li><b>Fuel temperature:</b> Displays the fuel temperature, which is also sometimes considered as the under-bonnet temperature.</li>
    <li><b>MAF reading:</b> Displays the reading from the mass airflow sensor as percentage of its maximum range. This display has two modes:
        <ul>
        <li><i>Linear:</i> Shows the reading as a percentage of the maximum airflow. It will vary linearly as the sensor measures more mass.</li>
        <li><i>Direct:</i> Shows the reading as a percentage of the maximum sensor voltage (5VDC). It will vary logarithmically as the sensor measures more mass.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Throttle position:</b> Displays the throttle position as a percentage of wide-open throttle (WOT). This display has two modes:
    <ul>
        <li><i>Absolute:</i> Calculates the percentage by dividing the raw reading by the maximum theoretical reading. Even when the throttle is closed and resting on its stop, the "Absolute" reading will still show some positive value.</li>
        <li><i>Corrected:</i> Adjusts the minimum end of the range so that a closed throttle shows as 0%.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Idle bypass position:</b> Displays the position of the idle air control stepper motor. 100% represents fully-open (greatest airflow) and 0% fully closed (restricted airflow).</li>
    <li><b>Target idle RPM:</b> The engine idle speed that the ECU would attempt to achieve under the current conditions.</li>
    <li><b>Selected gear:</b> The state of the neutral switch (for automatic gearboxes), or an indicator that a manual gearbox is fitted.</li>
    <li><b>Main voltage:</b> The voltage at the main relay.</li>
    <li><b>Lambda trim:</b> Fuel trim that is being applied as a result of feedback from the exhaust lambda sensors. There are two types of trim applied by the ECU, referred to as "short term" and "long term". The full effect of these fuel trim values is still under investigation.
        <ul>
        <li><i>Short term:</i> These will remain at their initialized values during warm-up, and then typically change rapidly while the engine is running.</li>
        <li><i>Long term:</i></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Current fuel map:</b> ID of the currently-selected fuel map, from 1 to 5. For most North American specification (NAS) Land Rovers, this will always be Map 5. In other markets, the map may be selected with the use of a "tune resistor" in the 14CUX wiring harness. A special sixth map, Map 0, is used for fail-safe/limp-home conditions.</li>
    <li><b>Adjustment factor:</b> This is a value associated with the current fuel map, and it seems to be used to adjust the fueling values for the engine displacement. It will change significantly between fuel maps intended for different engine displacements.</li>
    <li><b>Fuel map:</b> Displays the currently-selected fuel map as a 16x8 matrix. Each cell is colored as a quick visual indicator of the fueling values; higher color saturation corresponds to more fuel. Columns in the matrix correspond to different engine speeds, and rows correspond to different engine loads. The cell with the value closest to the fueling value currently in use will be highlighted by the software.</li>
    <li><b>Fuel pump relay:</b> The green lamp will be lit when the ECU is attempting to run the fuel pump.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Options dialog</h3>
    <p>Following is a description of the configuration options available in the "Options", "Edit settings" dialog.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Serial device name:</b> The name of the serial device connected to the 14CUX. If running Windows, this will be something like "COM2". If running Linux, it will be something like "/dev/ttyUSB0".</li>
    <li><b>Maximum speed on speedometer:</b> This merely changes the upper limit of the speedometer gauge display. It has no effect on the ECU. Because of limitations in the gauge display itself, only coarse changes will affect this setting.</li>
    <li><b>Temperature units:</b> Sets the preferred units of temperature for the coolant- and fuel-temperature displays.</li>
    <li><b>Enabled readings:</b> These checkboxes allow the user to enable reading only certain parameters. This allows the limited bandwidth of the diagnostic port to be used for only those parameters that interest the user. If fewer readings are enabled, they will update more quickly and smoothly than if all the readings are enabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Idle air control dialog</h3>
    <p>This dialog allows the user to drive the idle air control (IAC) valve in the intake plenum. Because the ECU is adjusting the valve when the engine is idling, it is recommended to only test movement of the valve when the engine is off. Otherwise, unpredictable behavior may result.</p> 
    <p>The motor controlling the valve has a total of 180 steps of movement, so commanding it to open or close by 180 (or more) steps will ensure that it reaches its fully-open or fully-closed position (assuming the valve is functioning mechanically.)</p>
